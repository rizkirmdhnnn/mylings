# Getting Started with Golang

Welcome to my first blog post! Today, I want to share my experience learning Go and building scalable backend systems.

## Why Golang?

Golang, or Go, has become one of my favorite programming languages for backend development. Here's why:

- **Simplicity**: Go has a clean and simple syntax that's easy to learn
- **Performance**: Compiled language with excellent performance
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for goroutines and channels
- **Great tooling**: Excellent standard library and tooling

## My First Go Program

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Building REST APIs

Go is excellent for building REST APIs. Here's a simple example using the standard library:

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "net/http"
)

type User struct {
    ID   int    `json:"id"`
    Name string `json:"name"`
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/users", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        users := []User{
            {ID: 1, Name: "John"},
            {ID: 2, Name: "Jane"},
        }
        json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(users)
    })

    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

## Conclusion

Go has been a game-changer for my backend development. The simplicity and performance make it perfect for building scalable systems.
